# PLVA Blueprint — Holo CUA Privacy Environment

This file specifies the **CUA-management component** of the PLVA project. It is written to be
built by an AI coding agent in small, independently testable steps.

> **Revision 2026-07-12.** Reworked from the original after building Steps 0–4 and clarifying the
> threat model with the operator. Material changes since the first draft: the threat model is now
> explicitly *"protect against the model inference provider and anything upstream of it"* (not the
> local desktop); per-class PII **safety levels** replace the fixed secret-tier list; an optional
> **LLM mediator** (approvals/steering) is added; the Gradium audio work is split into an
> **inbound** (context) and a privacy-free **outbound** (voice-read) direction; a thin **app** is
> added; and several statements are corrected (skills are native to HoloDesktop, not a NemoClaw
> feature; resolution scope is about leak-back, not destination). Build-step status and priority
> now reflect what is actually built. Search for **CHANGED** / **NEW** markers.

## 0. How to build from this document (read first)

- Build **one step at a time, in priority order** (§9). After each step, stop and run its
  **Verify** check. Do **not** start the next step until Verify passes. Steps marked ✅ are done.
- Prefer the smallest change that satisfies the step. Each step must be independently runnable.
- Treat everything under **Hard constraints** (§8) as non-negotiable. If a step seems to require
  breaking one, stop and surface it instead of proceeding.
- **Secrets:** never commit API keys, screenshots, transcripts, or vault contents. Keys live in
  environment variables and an untracked `.env` only. Keep a safe `.env.example`.
- **Stubs:** when a step depends on a component out of scope here (the PII detector), build against
  the **stub interface** in §5 so this component is testable before the real one exists.
- Any fact marked **VERIFY** is an assumption to confirm empirically. If it turns out false, stop
  and report — do not build on it.
- **NEW — local-model acceleration is in flight (separate agent).** The redaction detector and the
  local models it depends on are being sped up with GPU / WebGPU and Apple **CoreML** execution
  providers, behind a persistent warm worker (see the "Cross-cutting" note at the end of §9). Treat
  every local-model dependency (redactor, and later local TTS and a local mediator model) as
  *pluggable behind a client interface* whose backend may be WASM, WebGPU, or CoreML. Never hardcode
  a backend; keep the frozen baseline as the correctness oracle; keep the interface fail-closed.

## 1. Goal and scope

**PLVA** is a privacy layer for computer-use agents (CUAs). Full pipeline:

> screenshot → detect PII + bounding boxes → paint placeholders over the PII values
> (e.g. `PASSWORD_1`) → store the real values in a key-value **vault** keyed by placeholder →
> tell the model how to reason about placeholders → when the model returns actions, resolve each
> placeholder back to its real value **before** the action executes.

**Threat model (CHANGED — read carefully; it drives the rest of the doc).** Privacy is defined
**against the model inference provider (Overshoot) and anything upstream of the model.** The goal
is that the model **never *sees*** a value it should not need to know. It is *fine* for the model
to **cause a real value to be used** — typed into a form, placed in a URL, sent somewhere — because
that is the action the user asked for and the layer resolves the value locally, in transit, out of
the model's view. So the discipline is not "never let a real value reach any destination"; it is
"never let a real value reach the model or its provider." That reframing relaxes some earlier rules
(see §8.4) and sharpens others (history leak-back, §6/§8.9, is now the load-bearing concern).

**This component covers:**
- running the CUA, and **intercepting and modifying both directions of the model traffic** (request
  to the provider and returned actions) — the PLVA proxy;
- the **vault** and a **configurable per-class PII safety policy** (NEW, §6);
- an optional **LLM mediator** for approval-gated classes and privacy steering (NEW, §7);
- **audio** via Gradium, in two directions (NEW, §9 Steps 9, 10, 12): inbound STT → redacted context,
  and a privacy-free outbound **voice-read** of real values through a **local** TTS model;
- a thin **app** that takes a typed or (lower priority) spoken prompt and runs the task (NEW, §9
  Step 11).

**Out of scope (separate component):** the actual detection/redaction of PII pixels, and its
GPU/CoreML acceleration. Here the detector is a **pluggable dependency** with a stub (see §5). The
detector must, however, emit recognized **values** to the vault locally — see the §5 contract note.

## 2. Glossary

- **CUA** — computer-use agent: takes a screenshot + task, emits GUI actions (click/type/scroll).
- **Holo3** — H Company's vision computer-use model. This project uses Overshoot's
  **`Hcompany/Holo3-35B-A3B`** only. Consumes images + text; has **no native audio input** (audio
  reaches it only as injected text, §9 Step 12).
- **HoloDesktop CLI** — the harness (`github.com/hcompai/holo-desktop-cli`, Apache-2.0, Python/uv).
  Open CLI wrapper; downloads a **closed `hai-agent-runtime`** binary that owns the perceive→act
  loop (screen capture, model call, action execution). **CHANGED — skills:** HoloDesktop has its
  **own** native skill mechanism (`~/.holo/skills/*/SKILL.md`, loaded into the model request by the
  runtime). Skills are **not** a NemoClaw feature. Teaching the model about placeholders can use a
  native skill *or* proxy injection; we prefer proxy injection for guaranteed presence, optionally
  reinforced by a skill (§9 Steps 5 and 5a).
- **Overshoot** — the inference provider. OpenAI-compatible HTTP API.
- **NemoClaw / OpenShell** — NVIDIA's agent stack. **OpenShell** is its sandbox (network + file
  isolation). In this project it is used to **sandbox processes we launch** (primarily the mediator,
  optionally the proxy / audio client) with deny-by-default egress — **not** as an orchestrator
  brain and **not** to wrap the host runtime (it cannot). See §7.
- **PLVA proxy** — the local OpenAI-compatible HTTP proxy we build; the single point where model
  traffic is intercepted and rewritten. Built (Steps 1, 3, 4).
- **Vault** — private, in-memory, session-scoped map from placeholder → real value, plus per-class
  policy state.
- **Placeholder** — a stable, session-nonce-namespaced semantic token painted over a PII value,
  e.g. `EMAIL_1_a3f9`. The namespace prevents on-screen/adversarial forgery of a valid token.
- **Safety level** (NEW) — the per-class policy that decides how a PII class is handled: hide-and-
  use, approval-gated, blocked, etc. (§6).
- **Mediator** (NEW) — an LLM the proxy *consults* on deterministic triggers to approve/deny
  gated resolutions (against user-defined criteria) and to steer. A *mediator*, never an
  orchestrator: the proxy stays in control.
- **Gradium** — voice-AI provider: cloud **STT** (real-time, WebSocket, semantic VAD) and a
  **local TTS** model. Cloud STT sees pre-redaction audio (trusted-boundary assumption); local TTS
  runs on-device with no egress and is the key to the privacy-free outbound voice channel.
- **Audio-in / audio-out** (NEW) — *in*: mic/loopback → STT → scrub → model context (must be
  redacted before the model). *out*: vault → local TTS → speakers (never reaches the model, so it
  may carry real values).

## 3. Technical choices (fixed)

| Choice | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Model | **`Hcompany/Holo3-35B-A3B`** | Exact Overshoot model id. Do **not** use Nemotron, OpenClaw, or another model/harness. |
| Harness | **HoloDesktop CLI** | Closed `hai-agent-runtime` owns the loop — see §4 for why this forces a proxy. |
| Inference provider | **Overshoot** (OpenAI-compatible) | The proxy targets Overshoot by default. |
| NemoClaw integration | **OpenShell sandbox** for the **mediator** (and optionally proxy/audio) | Isolation + controlled egress for processes we launch; not an orchestrator; cannot wrap the host runtime. |
| Audio | **Gradium** STT (cloud) + **local** TTS | STT is trusted-boundary; local TTS enables the privacy-free voice-read (§9 Step 9). |
| Local-model acceleration | GPU / **WebGPU** / **CoreML** behind a warm worker | In flight (separate agent). Keep every local model behind a pluggable, fail-closed client. |

**Why a proxy and not "just change the request":** the closed `hai-agent-runtime` builds and sends
the request; we cannot edit that code, so the request never exists as our own object to modify. The
**only** knob is **where** it sends (its base URL). Pointing that at a local proxy is the only way
to see and rewrite the traffic. OpenAI-compatibility makes the proxy easy to write; it does not
remove the need for it. Actions flow back into the closed binary to be executed, so placeholder
resolution must also happen in the proxy, in transit. The proxy is likewise the only per-step seam
for injecting live audio context and for routing speak-actions to local TTS.

---

## 5. The PII detector interface (stub for this component)

The real detector is a separate component (and is being GPU/CoreML-accelerated elsewhere). Build
against a **stub** with a stable contract so the pipeline is testable now.

**`redact(frame)` → `{ redactedFrame, spans }`**
- `frame`: the screenshot pulled from the request.
- `redactedFrame`: a **new** image with placeholder chips painted over PII values; pixels outside
  the covered regions are byte-identical to the input.
- `spans`: list of `{ class, value, boundingBox, placeholder? }` for each detected PII value.

**CHANGED — the detector must emit recognized `value`s to the vault, locally.** Placeholder
stability, resolution, *and* history scrub are all impossible if the detector returns geometry
only. (The current frozen `plva-v2-baseline` is geometry-only — good enough for Step 4 obscuring,
**not** for Steps 5+.) The vault — not the detector — **owns placeholder assignment** for stability
(§6), so the detector emits `class/value/boundingBox` and the painter renders the vault's
placeholder. Values never leave the device and never appear in logs.

**Stub behavior for testing:** deterministic and configurable — detect a hardcoded string / fixed
region, paint a chip, return one span with its value. Provide a "detect nothing" mode and a "detect
fixture X" mode so tests can exercise the full store→resolve→scrub loop without a real detector.

The proxy depends only on this interface, never on the detector's internals or its acceleration
backend.

---

## 6. The vault and per-class safety policy (CHANGED)

Private, in-memory, session-scoped. Holds placeholder↔value maps plus per-class policy.

**Store (request leg):** for each detected span, canonicalize the value (normalize whitespace,
Unicode NFKC; keep credentials exact/case-sensitive), then look it up. Same value → **same**
placeholder; new value → next per-class counter → new placeholder, namespaced with a per-session
nonce (`EMAIL_1_a3f9`) so screen/adversarial text cannot forge a valid token.
> **CHANGED — duplicates tolerated for now.** Ideal is one stable placeholder per value across all
> frames. For this build it is acceptable for the same value to receive different placeholders
> across frames if stable assignment is hard; the only cost is possible multi-step incoherence
> ("I typed `EMAIL_1`, now it's `EMAIL_2`"). Revisit for stability later.

**Resolve (response leg):** given a placeholder, return its value **only if** it was issued this
session and its class's safety level permits, possibly after mediator approval (below).

**Per-class safety levels (NEW — replaces the fixed secret-tier list).** Each PII class maps to a
**configurable** level (defaults shipped, user-overridable via the app, §9 Step 6):
- **`hide_use`** — painted as a placeholder and freely resolvable. "Can use but hide." (Default for
  low-sensitivity classes: `EMAIL`, `PHONE`, `NAME`, `ADDRESS`.)
- **`approval`** — painted as a placeholder, but resolution is **denied until the mediator approves**
  against **user-defined criteria** (§7). "Use only with LLM approval." (Default for `API_KEY`,
  `AUTH_TOKEN`.)
- **`blocked`** — masked, **never stored, never resolvable**; the model gets an opaque mask, not a
  usable placeholder. "Cannot use." (Default for `PASSWORD`, `CVC`, `CARD_NUMBER`, `PRIVATE_KEY`.)
- **Additional levels to consider:** `voice_approval` (user approves by voice, §9 Step 9);
  `destination_scoped` (resolvable only toward an allowed destination); `out_of_band` (host fills a
  secret directly from the vault; the model never even receives a placeholder — the safe path for
  passwords, and the natural home for the voice secret-entry channel).

**Invariants:**
- Different values must **never** alias to the same placeholder (duplicates go the *other* way —
  one value may get several placeholders for now; never one placeholder for two values).
- **No persistence** anywhere (disk, IndexedDB, localStorage, logs, telemetry). Cleared on
  `dispose()`.
- A denied/blocked resolution **fails closed**: the action is not executed with a real value; the
  proxy may inform the CUA it was denied so it can adapt.

---

## 7. NemoClaw / OpenShell and the mediator (CHANGED)

**Egress topology (resolved — see `docs/decisions/0001`).** OpenShell **cannot wrap the host
runtime** (it only isolates processes it launches; no Linux `hai-agent-runtime` exists). So the
"only redacted data leaves" guarantee is enforced by (a) the fail-closed proxy code and (b) a
host-level packet-filter substitute on macOS, with OpenShell reserved for processes we *do* launch.
Skills do **not** require NemoClaw (corrected — see §2).

**Primary NemoClaw role now = the mediator sandbox (NEW).** The mediator is an LLM the proxy
**consults** when a deterministic flag trips (a resolution hits an `approval` class; a configurable
risk condition fires). It returns `{decision: approve|deny|modify, steering?, scope?}`; the proxy
enforces it. Control stays with the proxy — mediator, not orchestrator.

> **CRITICAL constraint.** A mediator that sees **cleartext** (real values / raw frame, needed for
> real judgment) **must run a fully local model with zero network egress** — otherwise its own LLM
> provider sees the secret and the leak reappears one layer up. Two allowed shapes:
> - **local-model mediator** → may see cleartext; **no egress** (run in OpenShell, egress denied;
>   or a local model on the host with a verified no-egress boundary);
> - **remote-model mediator** → may see **only** redacted/placeholder context, never raw values.
>
> Build toward the local, zero-egress mediator so "approve a secret unlock" is actually safe.

**Why OpenShell here (its genuine sweet spot):** it sandboxes a process *it launches*. Run the
mediator in a sandbox with **deny-by-default egress** (nothing, for a local model); reach it from
the proxy over `openshell forward service` (loopback-only gRPC); and use `openshell policy prove`
to *verify* the "no egress" invariant rather than assert it. Optionally sandbox the proxy and the
audio/TTS client the same way. **Caveat:** OpenShell is alpha and, if it cannot create its network
namespace, **degrades to observation (does not enforce)** — verify enforcement (a deny-test from
inside) before trusting it with cleartext.

Fail-closed: if the mediator is unreachable or times out, **deny**.

---

## 8. Hard constraints (do not violate)

1. **Fail closed.** If any stage fails, no request/response is forwarded and no raw frame or vault
   value ever reaches the model/provider. There is no raw fallback.
2. **Redacted-only egress *to the model*.** Overshoot must never receive an un-redacted screenshot,
   a vault value, or un-scrubbed history. (Real values reaching a *local* executor or the user's
   own destinations is expected — see the §1 threat model.)
3. **New output buffer.** Redaction renders into a new image; input pixels are never mutated.
4. **CHANGED — resolution scope is about leak-back, not destination.** Resolve placeholders in the
   **executed action fields** (type text, URLs, click targets — wherever the user's action needs
   the value). Do **not** resolve placeholders in the model's free-form **reasoning/thought text**:
   that is not executed and would only re-expose the value into history on the next turn.
5. **Privacy-safe logs.** Logs may contain class, placeholder, bounding box, backend, timings —
   **never** recognized text, real values, transcripts, or frames.
6. **No persistence of session state.** Vault and any cache are memory-only and dropped on dispose.
7. **Streaming-safe.** Handle **SSE / streamed** responses: buffer/parse enough to resolve the
   action before forwarding. Never forward an unresolved placeholder to the executor. (Built §3.)
8. **Model id is not hardcoded blindly.** Confirm the exact provider model-id via `/models` (§0).
9. **NEW — history scrub is mandatory and load-bearing.** Because the runtime remembers the
   *resolved* real value it executed, every outbound request's text history must be scrubbed:
   **plain vault match first, then a Rampart semantic reclassify** as a backstop for reformatted or
   never-vaulted PII (map hits back to the vault for a stable placeholder; fail-closed on unknown
   PII). This is best-effort, not a proof (Rampart has finite recall) — treat it as the primary
   residual risk and test it adversarially.
10. **NEW — the outbound voice channel must not feed back.** Real values spoken by local TTS must
    not be captured by audio-in (exclude our own output device / duck capture during playback) and
    must not be rendered on-screen as captions (a caption re-enters the model via the next frame).
11. **NEW — local acceleration stays fail-closed and offline.** A GPU/CoreML/WebGPU backend for any
    local model must not change fail-closed behavior and must not add network egress; the frozen
    baseline remains the correctness oracle.

---

## 9. Build steps (priority order; status marked)

Each step lists **Goal → Build → Verify**. Do not proceed past a failing Verify. After each step,
pause for operator verification and describe how to test it.

### ✅ Step 0 — Setup and external-contract probe — **COMPLETE**
Clean repo, secrets handling, confirmed contracts. `/models` confirmed `Hcompany/Holo3-35B-A3B`
ready; response shape recorded (structured JSON action in `message.content`, `tool_calls` array,
`structured_outputs` present, no native `tools`); streaming characterized. **Critical VERIFY
passed:** the closed runtime sends its screenshot through the configurable base URL (proven against
a loopback stub). Evidence in `Holo/verification/step-0-*`.

### ✅ Step 1 — HoloDesktop under isolation — **BUILT; live run pending key**
Pass-through proxy is the runtime's sole endpoint and sole provider egress. §7 egress decision
resolved (ADR-0001). The one-command `run_step1.sh` closes the end-to-end run once the operator's
Overshoot key is in `Holo/.env`. Live-frame streaming for that run is operator-authorized.

### ✅/⚙️ Step 2 — Overshoot inference + latency — **inference done; latency pending**
The proxy targets Overshoot by default. Remaining: record per-step and end-to-end latency
(p50/p95) for a fixed small task set from the proxy's privacy-safe timing logs.

### ✅ Step 3 — Interception proxy (no redaction) — **BUILT & verified**
Loopback OpenAI-compatible proxy with a request/response mutation seam, SSE buffered→mutated→
re-emitted, fail-closed. Verified with pass-through, the `test` hook, and a `banana` hook that
rewrites every text the CUA types (a live proof of the response-leg action-rewrite seam that Step 5
resolution reuses).

### ✅ Step 4 — Outbound obscuring (redaction) — **BUILT (accelerated); geometry-only**
The proxy redacts every outbound screenshot through the detector and serves the obscured frames at
a loopback `/viewer`; a persistent WebGPU/WASM worker keeps it warm (see Cross-cutting note).
**Gap:** the frozen detector is geometry-only, so no values reach the vault yet — which is exactly
what Step 5 needs.

---

### ✅ Step 5 — Vault + placeholder resolution + history scrub (the privacy core) — **COMPLETE**
- **Goal:** the model works with placeholders it can reason about but never sees the real values;
  actions resolve to real values in transit; history never re-exposes a resolved value.
- **Build:**
  - Detector emits `class/value/boundingBox` (§5); vault stores and assigns stable, nonce-namespaced
    placeholders (§6); painter renders the vault's placeholder chips.
  - **Teach the model** via proxy request-injection (preferred) or a native HoloDesktop skill:
    "regions shown as «CLASS_N…» are real values you cannot see; to use one, emit its token
    verbatim in an action; never guess the underlying value."
  - **Response leg:** reuse the Step 3 seam to resolve placeholders in executed action fields only
    (§8.4), conservatively matched (fail-closed on no confident match).
  - **History scrub (§8.9):** plain vault match, then Rampart reclassify; fail-closed on unknown PII.
- **Verify (fixtures):** forwarded request carries the redacted image and **no** real value; a
  `type` action with `EMAIL_1` resolves to the real value before execution while the same token in
  reasoning text is untouched; after a value is "typed," the next request's history no longer
  contains it; every injected stage failure forwards nothing; no log carries a real value.
- **VERIFY (empirical, do first):** confirm Holo3 actually honors placeholder instructions rather
  than hallucinating the hidden value. If not, rethink before building the rest.

**Completed 2026-07-12:** the Vision OCR/Rampart finding supplies the value and box to one
session-only vault assignment; the proxy paints the vault token on that same redacted box, injects
placeholder instructions, resolves only executed action fields, and scrubs outbound history by
plain vault match followed by the warm Core ML Rampart backstop. Deterministic fixtures, injected
failures, JSON/SSE proxy gates, and a synthetic Holo provider pass succeeded. Holo copied the exact
visible token into `write`; the proxy resolved it locally while leaving reasoning untouched. See
`Holo/verification/step-5-privacy-core.md`.

### ✅ Step 5a — Richer placeholder teaching (scheme + on-screen manifest + duplicate warning + skill)
- **Goal:** strengthen how the CUA is taught about placeholders. Step 5 already ships a *basic*
  injection and confirmed Holo3 copies a visible token verbatim into a `write`; 5a makes the
  teaching explicit and robust so the model reasons well across many tokens and edge cases. It tells
  the model three things and optionally reinforces them with a skill.
- **Build — the proxy request hook injects three parts** (input only, so `structured_outputs` is
  unaffected; every part carries tokens + class labels, **never** real values, so it is safe to sit
  in scrubbed history). Use the real nonce-namespaced tokens (§6); examples elide the suffix:
  1. **General scheme (static — same every request).** Draft:
     > "Some sensitive values on screen are hidden behind placeholder tokens written «CLASS_N»
     > (e.g. «EMAIL_1», «PHONE_2»); the real token also carries a short session suffix. Each token
     > stands for a real value you cannot see. Treat a token exactly as the real value of that
     > class — you may click it, type it, or otherwise act on it. To use a value, emit its token
     > **verbatim** (exact spelling, including the suffix) in the action field. Never invent, guess,
     > describe, or alter the underlying value. If a value you need is not shown as a token, do not
     > fabricate it."
  2. **On-screen manifest (dynamic — rebuilt each frame).** The proxy reads the vault's
     active-placeholder manifest for the *current* redacted frame and lists only the tokens actually
     present this step, with their class:
     > "Placeholders visible now: «EMAIL_1» (email), «PHONE_1» (phone), «ADDRESS_1» (postal
     > address)."
     Listing only current tokens (never stale ones) keeps the model from referencing a token that
     is not on screen; the class hints help it choose the right field.
  3. **Duplicate warning (static).** Per §6 (duplicates tolerated this build):
     > "Occasionally the same real value may appear under more than one token across steps
     > (e.g. «EMAIL_1» and «EMAIL_2» may be the same email); this is rare. Treat each token
     > independently and use whichever token labels the field you are acting on."
- **Placement / cadence:** inject the **scheme** and **duplicate warning** as (or appended to) a
  system-role message — **add** a message rather than overwriting the runtime's own system prompt,
  so Holo3's action behavior is undisturbed; attach the **manifest** to the current step's
  user/observation message so it sits next to the frame it describes. Re-inject every step (the
  manifest is per-frame; repeating the static parts is cheap and survives context truncation).
- **Reinforcing skill (recommended):** also ship a native HoloDesktop skill
  (`~/.holo/skills/plva-placeholders/SKILL.md`) carrying the **general scheme only** — skills are
  static, so they cannot hold the per-frame manifest or duplicate specifics, which stay in the proxy
  injection. The runtime loads the skill into context as a first-class capability doc, reinforcing
  the injection. Keep the proxy injection as the source of truth (guaranteed present, carries the
  dynamic parts); treat the skill as belt-and-suspenders.
- **Verify:** the manifest lists exactly the tokens in the current frame (no stale, none missing);
  in a crafted duplicate case (one value under two tokens) the model still acts correctly using the
  shown token; injection is input-only and never appears in model *output* fields; logs carry tokens
  + class only, never values. (Basic token-cooperation is already confirmed by Step 5.)

**Completed 2026-07-12:** every privacy-enabled request now receives a fresh system-role scheme
and duplicate warning plus a value-free manifest immediately beside the current screenshot. The
manifest is produced atomically by the same vault-paint operation, lists only token/class pairs,
explicitly says `none` when the current frame has no tokens, and removes older injected manifests
before forwarding. The action syntax clarifies that Holo must emit the exact inner token without
the decorative guillemets. A static `plva-placeholders` HoloDesktop skill reinforces the scheme;
the proxy remains authoritative. Unit/integration tests cover exact current-frame membership,
stale-token removal, empty manifests, malformed-token rejection, and absence of cleartext. See
`Holo/verification/step-5a-placeholder-teaching.md`.

### 🔲 Step 6 — Configurable per-class PII safety policy
- **Goal:** the user chooses, per class, `hide_use` / `approval` / `blocked` (and later variants).
- **Build:** a policy config (file + app UI, §9 Step 11) with sensible defaults (§6); the vault's
  resolve gate enforces the level; `blocked` never stores; `approval` defers to Step 7.
- **Verify:** flipping a class between levels changes behavior as specified; `blocked` values are
  never resolvable and never stored; defaults protect secrets out of the box.

### 🔲 Step 7 — LLM mediator (OpenShell) for approvals + steering
- **Goal:** `approval`-class resolutions and configurable risk flags are decided by a mediator
  against user-defined criteria, safely.
- **Build:** proxy consults the mediator on a tripped flag (synchronous gate for approvals; async
  advisor for steering); verdict `{approve|deny|modify, steering?, scope?}`; fail-closed on
  unreachable/timeout. Mediator runs in an OpenShell sandbox — **local model, zero egress** if it
  sees cleartext (§7) — reached via `forward service`; verify enforcement with `policy prove`.
- **Verify:** an `approval` value resolves only after approval and only within granted scope; a
  denied request blocks with no real value used; mediator sandbox has provably no egress; with the
  mediator down, everything gated fails closed.

### 🔲 Step 8 — SPEAK-mechanism spike (prerequisite for voice-read)
- **Goal:** determine empirically *how*, if at all, Holo3 can signal "read this aloud" — before
  building voice-read (Step 9). One instrumented run also captures Holo3's `structured_outputs`
  grammar and settles the Step 5 placeholder-cooperation question, so do it once and reuse.
- **Build:** a Step-0-style capture (non-sensitive: record the action/grammar schema, never frames
  or values), then with prompts like *"read me the most upvoted comment on this thread"* test the
  **top 3 candidate mechanisms**, ranked, recording for each whether the grammar permits it and
  whether the model actually emits it:
  1. **Structured SPEAK (text payload).** Teach the model to emit a SPEAK carrying the text to
     speak (placeholders allowed for embedded PII). Tests whether `structured_outputs` permits a
     novel action/field at all, and whether the model complies and reproduces the text. Weakness:
     long-text transcription fidelity.
  2. **Point-and-flag (SPEAK-by-reference).** Teach the model to indicate a screen location
     (coordinates / region / DOM element) plus a "read here" flag — reusing an existing
     coordinate-bearing action shape where possible — and have local DOM (`browser_exec get_text`)
     or original-frame OCR do the actual reading. Tests whether the model can reliably point at the
     intended element ("most upvoted comment") and signal read-intent in a proxy-parseable form.
     Strength: exact text, no length limit, model emits no content.
  3. **Free-text marker in native output.** The model embeds a recognizable marker
     (e.g. `⟦SPEAK⟧…⟦/SPEAK⟧`) in a free-text field it already emits (thought/answer), which the
     proxy scans. The loosest-coupling fallback: tests whether *any* smuggled convention survives
     the grammar and is actually used.
- **Verify:** a recorded yes/no per option on (a) grammar-permitted and (b) model-complies, the
  captured schema, and a recommendation of which mechanism Step 9 builds — plus the fallback
  (app/user-triggered read: the model or user selects a region, the app extracts+speaks locally) if
  none work model-side. Nothing sensitive is recorded.

### 🔲 Step 9 — Voice-read out: local Gradium TTS + placeholder resolution
- **Goal:** the CUA can read parts of the screen aloud to the user, **including complex,
  reasoning-selected content and PII**, without any real value reaching the model or Gradium's cloud.
- **Build:** implement the mechanism chosen in Step 8 behind one **SPEAK contract** that carries
  *either* inline `text` (verbatim, placeholders allowed — resolved via the vault) *or* a `ref`
  (region / DOM element) that local `browser_exec get_text` or original-frame OCR reads exactly.
  The response hook resolves/extracts and hands the real text to a **local** Gradium TTS client
  (fail-closed, offline-verified), returning a benign no-op to the runtime (it has no speech
  executor). For the `ref` path, intercept the tool *result* so extracted text goes to TTS, never
  back into the model's context. Enforce the anti-feedback rule (§8.10). Ship the inline-`text`
  shape first (stub TTS → real model), then add `ref` for fidelity.
- **Verify:** "read the most upvoted comment" voices the correct text locally; a `text` SPEAK with
  `EMAIL_1` voices the real email; the real value / extracted text appears in **no** request to
  Overshoot and **no** Gradium cloud call; TTS output is not recaptured by audio-in.

### 🔲 Step 10 — Spoken prompt input (Gradium STT) — **LOWER PRIORITY**
- **Goal:** the user can *speak* the initial/continuing task prompt instead of typing it.
- **Build:** mic capture → Gradium STT → scrub (any PII in the spoken prompt goes through the vault
  before reaching the model) → hand to the app/runtime as the task. A local intent classifier
  routes utterances: app-control (local only), CUA-steering (scrubbed→injected), mediator-approval
  (→ Step 7).
- **Verify:** a spoken prompt runs the task identically to the typed prompt; spoken PII is
  placeholdered before the model sees it; "approve"-type utterances reach the mediator, not Overshoot.

### 🔲 Step 11 — The app (user-facing wrapper)
- **Goal:** one app to enter a typed prompt (or spoken, Step 10), configure per-class safety levels
  (Step 6), toggle voice-read (Step 9), and watch the `/viewer`.
- **Build:** thin UI over the proxy + runtime; safety-policy editor; run controls; the obscured-frame
  viewer; audio toggles. No secret, real value, transcript, or frame is persisted or logged.
- **Verify:** a non-technical run works end-to-end from the app; safety-level changes take effect;
  the viewer shows exactly what the model sees; nothing sensitive is written to disk.

### 🔲 Step 12 — Audio-in context: Gradium STT (loopback) → scrub → inject — **LOWER PRIORITY**
- **Goal:** live computer audio becomes redacted text context the CUA can reason with.
- **Build:** capture system/loopback audio (OS-specific — the fiddly part; macOS needs a virtual
  device); stream to Gradium STT (WebSocket); take **finalized** segments; run each through the
  **same** vault + Rampart scrub (shared placeholders with the screen); inject via the proxy
  request seam with a de-dupe cursor. Optionally sandbox the Gradium client (egress only to
  Gradium). Note the trusted-boundary assumption: Gradium's cloud hears pre-redaction audio.
- **Verify:** a spoken value appears to the model only as a placeholder and resolves like an
  on-screen value; with audio disabled, behavior is unchanged.

---

**Cross-cutting — local-model acceleration (separate agent, keep in mind).** The redaction detector
is being sped up with a **persistent warm worker**: the visual model runs on **WebGPU** where
available, OCR runs concurrently on a separate WASM runtime, sessions stay warm during a CUA burst
and release after idle, and exact repeated frames hit a bounded redacted-output-only memory cache.
Apple **CoreML** execution is part of the same effort. **Implications for anyone continuing this
work:** (1) local models (detector now; local TTS in Step 9; a local mediator model in Step 7) must
sit behind a **pluggable client** with `auto|webgpu|wasm|coreml` backends — never hardcode one;
(2) the frozen baseline stays the **correctness oracle**; (3) acceleration must not weaken
fail-closed behavior or add egress (§8.11); (4) the accelerated worker source lives in
`Holo/redactor-worker/` and its Python client in `Holo/src/plva_proxy/redactor.py`
(`AcceleratedRedactor`).

## 10. Definition of done (this component)

- HoloDesktop runs `Hcompany/Holo3-35B-A3B` via Overshoot, with the proxy as sole provider egress.
- The proxy intercepts both directions, redacts outbound frames, **resolves inbound placeholders in
  executed fields**, scrubs history (plain + Rampart), and handles streaming.
- Per-class **safety levels** are configurable; `blocked` classes are never resolvable; `approval`
  classes resolve only via the **mediator**, which runs local-and-zero-egress when it sees cleartext.
- **Voice-read** speaks real values locally with none reaching the model or Gradium's cloud; audio-in
  context is placeholdered before the model; the app runs a task from a typed (or spoken) prompt.
- Every §8 constraint has a direct test; the history-scrub weak point is tested adversarially.
- No key, real value, transcript, or frame is ever committed or logged.
- The detector remains a clean plug-in seam (real, accelerated detector replaces the stub with no
  proxy changes), and all local models stay behind pluggable, fail-closed, offline clients.
